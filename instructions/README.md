# Instructions Folder

This folder contains skill/instruction documents for LLMs interacting with the Community Research MCP server.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `community-research-skill.md` | Comprehensive guide covering philosophy, query crafting, source intelligence, advanced patterns, and interactive workflows |
| `quick-reference.md` | Condensed cheat sheet for rapid consultation during conversations |

## Usage

These documents are designed to be consumed by LLMs (like Claude) to understand how to effectively use the `community_search` tool. They follow the "Claude skill" pattern - teaching the model not just *what* the tool does, but *when*, *why*, and *how* to use it for maximum effectiveness.

## For LLM Developers

Point your LLM to these documents when configuring the Community Research MCP server. The skill file teaches:

- Query formulation strategies
- Source-specific intelligence (what each community is best for)
- Result interpretation and quality scoring
- Multi-step workflows for common scenarios
- Failure handling and edge cases
- Pro tips distilled from real usage patterns
